8051INstruction Project
===================

###Why I make this ?

This project is a part of my free time hobby.   
Currently, I'm studying Microprocessor and Interfacing course using Intel 8051 microprocessor.  
For sure, the programming language is assembly.

###The problem #@!~`()&*%)^

At first, I have to search for specific instruction on the paper, and it takes time
to fine one. Searching manually on paper is fine, but is there anyway to make it faster ??  

The answer is **Yes**

###8051IN Project

The project is a website that do the followings.  

The website groups related instructions together in groups called "Instruction Group".
User can easily get to specific group by using the navigation bar and clicking at the group link.  

**That was fast~!!**

Moreover, searching allows user to get to specific instruction *extremely* fast.
Just type the instruction in search field. Boom! the instruction table update result
according to the search instruction.

**And now, I am very HAPPY with assembly :3**

* jQuery - DOM manipulation
* bootstrap - Stylish UI in a second
* lunr.js - full-text search library
